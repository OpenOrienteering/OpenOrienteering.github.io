This patch release contains bug fixes, minor improvements and updated translations. Key changes:

- Adds a "Toolbars" menu to the "View" menu, make un-hiding of toolbars easy (#1155).
- Fixes printing and PDF issues with templates (#1163), opacity, grid lines (#733).
- Fixes issues with details missing from maps being used as templates on Android (#1186).
- Adds transparency to the default color for unstyled areas in GDAL/OGR templates, making overlap immediately visible (#1161). As an alternative, we added a setting for displaying GDAL/OGR templates in baseline and/or hatching style.
- Fixes an issue with GDAL/OGR not being used by default for DXF and OSM (#1166).
- The Android app no longer stores the compass-derived view rotation which could not be reset on the desktop (#1165).
- Fixes some crashes on Undo operations related to Map parts (#1168).
- Mitigates issues when using tool buttons during drawing (#1175).
