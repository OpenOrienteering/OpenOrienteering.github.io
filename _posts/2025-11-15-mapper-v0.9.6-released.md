## Deprecations

This release is still based on the same software stack as 2021's v0.9.5, and so it stills supports old Windows, macOS and Android devices. The next releases must move to a modernized software stack and will drop support for old platforms which already lost vendor support.

## Sadly missing

This release doesn't include new (current) IOF symbol sets.

This release contains 503 commits with 319 changed files since v0.9.5. This time, many thanks go to **35 contributors**.
