We are proud to announce the release of OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.9.3. This official release includes bug fixes and new features. Key changes since v0.9.2 are:

## Enhancements

- When drawing, follow border lines of line symbols, just as following the middle line.
- Improved geospatial data handling with GDAL:
  - Detecting drivers by file content if possible.
  - Opening OziExplorer's files as templates.
  - On import, clip vector data to the declared extent, useful for exports from OSM.
- Simple support for NMEA position sources on Linux and macOS (e.g. from Bluetooth).
- Additional space between object control points and selection rectangle.
- Template list button in toolbar.
- Translation updates.

## Fixed bugs

- **Specifying raster image coordinate reference system**.
- **Positioning of new OCD templates**, 
  and positioning of some existing templates.
- Initialization of georeferencing for OCD files.
- Vector data coordinate transformations for certain CRS, affecting e.g.  EPSG:27700 (OSGB36).
- OSM import of roads.
- Handling of border line as area outline.
- Rare crashes.

This release contains 196 commits with 133 changed files since v0.9.2. Many thanks go to 26 contributors.
