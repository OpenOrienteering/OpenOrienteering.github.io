A selection of other changes:

- Corrections for some issues with opening or importing maps and data.
  - Fix for some maps not being loaded at all.
  - Fix for incorrect import of text object boxes from another map.
  - Fixes for some issues with importing OCD files.
  - Fix for crash when loading some files via GDAL/OGR.
- Helper symbols (e.g. for field work) no longer affect the automatic symbol icon scaling.
- Fixed a number of quirks of the paint-on-template tool.
- macOS: Fixed missing menu items in some translations (at least Czech).
- Android: Made the special touch cursor working again.
- Android: Fixed loss of previous GPX track when tracking was started again on the same day).
