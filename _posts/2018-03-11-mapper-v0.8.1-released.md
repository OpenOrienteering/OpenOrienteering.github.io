A selection of other changes:

- Corrections for some issues with opening or importing maps and data.
  - Fix for some maps not being loaded at all (#1061).
  - Fix for incorrect import of text object boxes from another map (#1069).
  - Fixes for some issues with importing OCD files (#1047, #1070).
  - Fix for crash when loading some files via GDAL/OGR (#1054).
- Helper symbols (e.g. for field work) no longer affect the automatic symbol icon scaling (#1051).
- Fixed a number of quirks of the paint-on-template tool.
- macOS: Fixed missing menu items in some translations (at least Czech, #1067).
- Android: Made the special touch cursor working again (#1063).
