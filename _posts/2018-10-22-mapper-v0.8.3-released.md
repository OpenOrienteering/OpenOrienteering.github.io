This patch release contains bug fixes and updated translations. Key changes:

- The Android app now explicitly tells the system's "media scanner" when it wrote a file.
  This should resolve most issues with invisible or corrupted files (which were healthy and valid on the Android device).
- On Android, the GPS location marker is now much more visible, and it blinks after move-to-my-location.
- Copy-and-paste of text objects will no longer create duplicate text symbols.
- The application no longer crashes when undoing map part merges or when deleting GDAL parameters.
